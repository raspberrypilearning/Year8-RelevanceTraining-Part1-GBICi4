## Part 1: Year 8 'Relevance' training – Introduction

Hello, and welcome to the Relevance trial, part of the Gender Balance in Computing programme. In Part 1, you will be introduced to the Gender Balance in Computing programme and the Relevance trial.

The online course is split into three parts. You can access the parts at different times, or complete the whole course at one time. You will be able to revisit the three parts until the end of the Relevance trial. You should allow up to four hours in total to complete the training. Remember that your school can be reimbursed for supply cover for these four hours.

### Course content

Part 1 focuses on some of the research used as the basis for the trial, so that you can better understand why introducing a real-world focus in your lesson could affect the gender balance in computing in your school. The Relevance trial and the research behind it will be introduced, including why relating learning to addressing real-world problems ('relevance') is thought to be engaging for girls. You will also consider some of the practicalities of implementing 'relevance' in your classroom.

Parts 2 and 3 allow you time to explore the resources so that you are fully at ease with the content before the trial begins. These parts of the online training course also include some hands-on development activities for you to complete in order to further your understanding of the resources and App Lab. The resources take a ‘learning-by-doing’ approach and thus require you to work through the materials as if you are a pupil. This will ensure that you have the familiarity that you need for you to be able to fully undertake the trial. You will need to register your completion of the tasks, as they form part of your engagement in the trial.
