## Session 1: KS1 'Storytelling' training – Introduction

Hello, and welcome to the 'Storytelling' Teaching Approach trial, part of the Gender Balance in Computing programme. In this first session, you will be introduced to the Gender Balance in Computing programme and the Teaching Approach trial.

The online course is split into three sessions. You can access the sessions at different times, or complete the whole course at one time. You will be able to revisit the three sessions until the end of the Teaching Approach trial. 
 
The 'Introduction to Storytelling' webinar was based on the information in this session, Session 1. If you attended the webinar, you may wish to skip to Session 2, or you can revisit the information by working through this session.
 
If you did not attend the webinar, you can watch the recording or work your way through this session to ensure that you understand the background and emphasis of the trial. If you would like to watch the recording, please see the video and slide deck below:

### Session content

Session 1 focuses on some of the research used as the basis for the trial, so that you can better understand why changing your teaching approach could affect the gender balance in computing in your school. The 'Storytelling' approach and the research behind it will be introduced, including why storytelling is thought to be engaging for girls. You will also consider some of the practicalities of implementing storytelling in your classroom.

Sessions 2 and 3 allow you time to explore the resources so that you are fully at ease with the content before the trial begins. These sessions also include some hands-on development activities for you to complete in order to further your understanding of the resources and ScratchJr. You will need to register your completion of the tasks, as they form part of your engagement in the trial.
