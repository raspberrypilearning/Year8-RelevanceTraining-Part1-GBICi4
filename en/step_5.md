## Why would girls benefit from considering the relevance of computing to them?

The premise of the Relevance trial is that the way in which computing is taught may not always match the ways in which girls prefer to learn, or their interests. It can often be seen as quite an abstract subject.

A focus on practicality and use of the subject can be seen in the computing qualifications that female students in the UK tend to choose: female students are better represented in computing subjects that are viewed as more practical than computer science, such as those involving creative digital media ([Kemp et al., 2018](https://www.bcs.org/media/3972/tracer-2017.pdf)).

**Solving problems and achieving goals**
Part of being a 'practical' subject involves showing female students that computing can help to solve problems that are important to them, and that it can help them to achieve their goals:
+ Research in the United States has suggested that female undergraduates are more likely to have goals related to helping others compared to male computing students, and that they do not always recognise the opportunities that computer science affords to meet these goals ([Lewis et al., 2019](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3291279.3339426))
+ Increasing the relevance of computing to students' lives has been shown to increase engagement of female undergraduates, producing a gender balance in the courses taken and resulting in improved retention of students over time ([Guzdial and Tew, 2006](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1151588.1151597))

This GBIC study is the first piece of research to focus on how secondary schoolâ€“aged students are affected by increasing the sense of relevance of computing through solving real-world problems.

**Pause and reflect**
Do you notice differences in how interested female and male students are in computing? Have you noticed differences in the ways in which female and male students use computers or computing lessons?
